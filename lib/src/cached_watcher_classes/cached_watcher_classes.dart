/// The `cached_watcher_classes` library provides a collection of specialized cached watcher classes
/// for Flutter applications. These classes extend the capabilities of the standard watcher classes
/// by adding local caching functionalities. Each cached watcher class is designed to work with a specific
/// data type, allowing for efficient state management with the added benefit of caching state for improved
/// performance and offline capabilities.
